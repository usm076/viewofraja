## Key Financial Metrics to Understand

### Valuation Metrics

#### Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E)
- **Formula:** Stock Price ÷ Earnings Per Share
- **What it means:** How much investors pay for $1 of earnings
- **Good range:** 15-25 for most stocks (varies by industry)
- **Example:** Stock at $100 with $5 EPS = 20 P/E ratio

#### Price-to-Sales Ratio (P/S)
- **Formula:** Market Cap ÷ Annual Revenue
- **Use case:** Valuing companies with little or no profit
- **Good range:** Under 2 for mature companies, higher for growth
- **Helpful for:** Early-stage or cyclical companies

#### Price-to-Book Ratio (P/B)
- **Formula:** Stock Price ÷ Book Value Per Share
- **What it measures:** Price relative to company's net worth
- **Good range:** Under 3 for most stocks
- **Best for:** Asset-heavy businesses like banks, real estate

#### PEG Ratio (Price/Earnings to Growth)
- **Formula:** P/E Ratio ÷ Expected Growth Rate
- **Sweet spot:** Under 1.0 indicates good value for growth
- **Example:** 20 P/E with 25% growth = 0.8 PEG (attractive)

### Profitability Metrics

#### Return on Equity (ROE)
- **Formula:** Net Income ÷ Shareholders' Equity
- **What it measures:** How efficiently company uses shareholder money
- **Good range:** 15%+ for most industries
- **Higher is better:** Shows management effectiveness

#### Profit Margins
- **Gross Margin:** (Revenue - Cost of Goods) ÷ Revenue
- **Operating Margin:** Operating Income ÷ Revenue  
- **Net Margin:** Net Income ÷ Revenue
- **Trend matters:** Look for stable or improving margins

#### Debt-to-Equity Ratio
- **Formula:** Total Debt ÷ Total Equity
- **Risk indicator:** Higher debt = higher financial risk
- **Industry varies:** Utilities can handle more debt than tech
- **Red flag:** Rapidly increasing debt levels
