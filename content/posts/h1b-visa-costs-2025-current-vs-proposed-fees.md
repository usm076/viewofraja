## Financial Planning Strategies

### For Prospective H1B Applicants
1. **Build substantial savings** - Aim for $150K+ emergency fund
2. **Negotiate salary increases** - Factor visa costs into compensation
3. **Consider alternative visas** - O-1, L-1 may become more attractive
4. **Explore employer partnerships** - Some may offer loan programs

### For Employers
1. **Budget planning** - Factor $100K+ per H1B into hiring costs
2. **Alternative talent strategies** - Remote work, international offices
3. **Employee retention** - Higher investment means longer commitments
4. **Salary adjustments** - May need to increase compensation packages

## Market Implications

### Startup Impact
- **Current:** Small companies can sponsor H1B workers
- **Proposed:** $100K fee eliminates most startup sponsorships
- **Result:** Talent concentration in large corporations

### Salary Negotiations
- H1B workers may demand higher salaries to offset costs
- Employers may prefer domestic workers to avoid fees
- Premium for H1B talent may increase significantly

## Timeline Considerations

### Implementation Scenarios
- **Immediate implementation:** Current applicants grandfathered
- **Phased rollout:** Gradual fee increases over 2-3 years
- **Renewal impact:** Existing H1B holders face new fees at renewal
