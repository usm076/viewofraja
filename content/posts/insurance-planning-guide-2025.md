Insurance is the foundation of any solid financial plan, yet it's often overlooked until it's too late. In 2025, with rising healthcare costs and economic uncertainty, having the right insurance coverage is more critical than ever.

## Why Insurance Planning Matters

Insurance serves as your financial safety net, protecting you and your family from:
- **Catastrophic medical expenses**
- **Loss of income due to disability**
- **Financial hardship from premature death**
- **Property damage and liability claims**
- **Long-term care costs**

Think of insurance as buying peace of mind and protecting the wealth you're building through your other financial strategies.

## Essential Types of Insurance Coverage

### 1. Health Insurance

**Why It's Critical:**
Medical bankruptcies account for 66% of personal bankruptcies in the US. Even with insurance, out-of-pocket costs can be substantial.

**2025 Key Considerations:**
- **High-Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs)** paired with HSAs
- **Telehealth coverage** expansion
- **Mental health parity** requirements
- **Prescription drug cost controls**

**Choosing the Right Plan:**
- Calculate total annual costs (premiums + deductibles + out-of-pocket max)
- Check if your doctors are in-network
- Consider prescription drug coverage
- Evaluate HSA eligibility if choosing HDHP

### 2. Life Insurance

**Term vs. Permanent Life Insurance:**

**Term Life Insurance:**
- Lower cost, temporary coverage
- Best for: Young families, mortgage protection, income replacement
- Recommended coverage: 10-12x annual income

**Permanent Life Insurance (Whole/Universal):**
- Higher cost, lifelong coverage with cash value
- Best for: Estate planning, business succession, high net worth individuals

**2025 Recommendations:**
- **Haven Life** - Competitive term rates, online application
- **Ladder** - Flexible term life with easy adjustments
- **Ethos** - No medical exam required for many applicants

### 3. Disability Insurance

**The Overlooked Essential:**
You're 3x more likely to become disabled than die during your working years, yet only 5% of workers have long-term disability insurance.

**Types of Coverage:**
- **Short-term disability** - 3-12 months of coverage
- **Long-term disability** - Until retirement age
- **Social Security Disability** - Government benefit (difficult to qualify)

**Key Features to Look For:**
- **Own-occupation coverage** - Pays if you can't perform your specific job
- **Cost of living adjustments** - Protection against inflation
- **Residual benefits** - Partial payments for partial disability
- **Guaranteed renewable** - Can't be cancelled due to health changes

### 4. Property Insurance

**Homeowners/Renters Insurance:**
- **Dwelling coverage** - Rebuilds your home
- **Personal property** - Replaces belongings
- **Liability protection** - Protects against lawsuits
- **Additional living expenses** - Temporary housing costs

**Auto Insurance:**
- **Liability coverage** - Required by law in most states
- **Comprehensive/Collision** - Protects your vehicle
- **Uninsured motorist** - Protection from uninsured drivers
