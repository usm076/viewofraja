You can't manage what you don't measure. This simple truth is why tracking your money is the foundation of every successful financial plan. Yet most people either don't track at all or give up after a few weeks.

## Why Money Tracking Changes Everything

Tracking your money isn't about restriction - it's about awareness. When you know where every dollar goes, you gain the power to redirect it toward your goals.

**The Psychology Behind It:**
- **Awareness effect** - Simply tracking reduces spending by 12-18%
- **Accountability** - You become conscious of impulse purchases
- **Pattern recognition** - Identify spending triggers and habits
- **Goal alignment** - See if spending matches your priorities

**Real Results:**
Studies show people who track expenses for just one month reduce unnecessary spending by an average of $600 annually.

- Rental income

**Variable Income:**
- Bonuses and commissions

## Method 1: Manual Tracking (The Foundation)

### The Envelope Method (Digital or Physical)
Allocate cash or digital "envelopes" for each spending category.

**How It Works:**
1. Determine monthly amount for each category
2. When you spend, deduct from that envelope
3. When envelope is empty, you're done spending in that category

**Best For:** People who need strict spending limits and visual cues.

### The Receipt Method
Keep every receipt and log expenses daily.

**Daily Process:**
1. Collect all receipts
2. Log each expense with date, amount, category
3. Note payment method (cash, card, etc.)
4. Add brief description if needed

**Tools Needed:**
- Small notebook or phone app
- Dedicated wallet pocket for receipts
- 5 minutes daily for logging

### The Bank Statement Method
Review and categorize all transactions weekly.

**Weekly Process:**
1. Download bank and credit card statements
2. Categorize each transaction
3. Look for patterns and surprises
4. Update running totals by category

### Zero-Based Expense Tracking
Every dollar gets assigned before the month begins:

### The Percentage Method
Track spending as percentages of income:
- Housing: 25-30%
