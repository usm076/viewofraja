## Strategy 1: The Debt Snowball Method

### How It Works
1. **List all debts** from smallest to largest balance
2. **Pay minimums** on all debts
3. **Attack the smallest debt** with extra payments
4. **Roll payments** to next smallest debt when first is paid off

### Example Debt Snowball

- Credit Card B: $2,000 balance, $50 minimum  
- Personal Loan: $8,000 balance, $200 minimum

- Credit Card B: 22.99% APR, $2,000 balance
- Personal Loan: 12% APR, $8,000 balance
