Cryptocurrency taxation can feel overwhelming, but understanding the rules is crucial for every crypto investor. The IRS has been increasingly focused on crypto compliance, and getting it wrong can result in significant penalties. This comprehensive guide will walk you through everything you need to know about crypto taxes in 2025.

## What You Need to Know Upfront

The IRS treats cryptocurrency as **property, not currency**. This means every crypto transaction is potentially a taxable event that must be reported on your tax return. Whether you made $10 or $10,000 from crypto, you need to understand these rules.

**Key takeaway:** Ignorance isn't a defense. The IRS expects you to report all crypto transactions, even if you didn't receive a tax form.

## How to Calculate Crypto Gains and Losses

### **Step-by-Step Calculation:**

**1. Determine your basis (cost):**
- Purchase price + fees + commissions

**2. Determine sale price:**
- Sale price - fees - commissions

**3. Calculate gain/loss:**
- Sale price - Basis = Gain/Loss

### **Example Calculation:**

```
Purchase: 1 Bitcoin for $30,000 + $50 fee = $30,050 basis
Sale: 1 Bitcoin for $45,000 - $75 fee = $44,925 proceeds
Capital Gain: $44,925 - $30,050 = $14,875

If held >1 year: Long-term capital gain (15% tax for most people)
If held ≤1 year: Short-term capital gain (taxed as ordinary income)
```

### **Cost Basis Methods:**

**FIFO (First In, First Out):** Default method
- Sell oldest crypto first
- Generally results in more long-term gains

**LIFO (Last In, First Out):**
- Sell newest crypto first
- May result in more short-term gains

**Specific Identification:**
- Choose which specific coins to sell
- Most tax-efficient if tracked properly
